# A*
Analysis of the A* Graph Traversal Algorithm. This is a midterm assignment for class CS3353 Algorithms where I explain in a post to the website Medium the graph traversal algorithm A*, pronounced A Star.
### What is Contained
In this repo there are:
- My word documents which I used for planning how I was going to write the medium post associated with the assignment 
- The code that I used from a public sourced repo along with the modifications I made to it
- The images and pictures I used in the blog post.
All resources used are collected into the repo for easy access outside of the post itself.
